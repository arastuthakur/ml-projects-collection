# Customer Segmentation Analysis With Dimensionality Reduction, Pipeline Optimization, Error Analysis, And Custom Scoring Metrics

## Customer Segmentation Analysis with Dimensionality Reduction, Pipeline Optimization, Error Analysis, and Custom Scoring Metrics

### Project Overview

**Main objectives:**

* To segment customers based on their demographics and purchase behavior.
* To reduce the dimensionality of the data for efficient model training.
* To optimize the machine learning pipeline for improved performance.
* To analyze model errors and identify areas for improvement.

**Key features:**

* Data preprocessing with dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
* Pipeline optimization with GridSearchCV to tune model hyperparameters.
* Error analysis with custom scoring metrics to evaluate model performance on business-specific metrics.

**Technical highlights:**

* Implementation of multiple clustering algorithms (MeanShift, AffinityPropagation, OPTICS).
* Use of Scikit-Learn's Pipeline and GridSearchCV for efficient model training and optimization.
* Calculation of adjusted Rand index, adjusted mutual information, and homogeneity scores for model evaluation.

### Technical Details

**Model architecture:**

The project utilizes three clustering algorithms: MeanShift, AffinityPropagation, and OPTICS. Each model has its own specific parameters that are optimized during the training process.

**Data processing pipeline:**

The data preprocessing pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Imputation of missing values
3. Feature scaling
4. Dimensionality reduction using PCA

**Key algorithms:**

* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of features while preserving the most important information.
* **MeanShift:** A non-parametric clustering algorithm that finds dense regions in the data.
* **AffinityPropagation:** A clustering algorithm that propagates similarities between data points to form clusters.
* **OPTICS:** A density-based clustering algorithm that can detect clusters of varying densities.

### Performance Metrics

**Evaluation results:**

The models were evaluated using the following clustering metrics:

* Adjusted Rand Index
* Adjusted Mutual Information
* Homogeneity

**Benchmark comparisons:**

The performance of the proposed models was compared to the baseline k-means algorithm. The results showed that the proposed models achieved significantly higher accuracy and stability.

**Model strengths:**

* The models are robust to noise and outliers in the data.
* The models can identify clusters of varying densities and shapes.
