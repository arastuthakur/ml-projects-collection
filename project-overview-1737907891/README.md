## Technical Details

### Model Architecture

This project incorporates three prominent classification algorithms:

- **Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees.
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier:** A sequential ensemble method that iteratively trains weak learners.
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC):** A non-probabilistic classifier that constructs a hyperplane to separate classes.

### Data Processing Pipeline

- Data normalization: Scales the data to have a zero mean and unit variance.
- Feature selection: Analyzes data and selects the most informative features.
- Dimensionality reduction: Reduces the number of features using methods like PCA.

### Key Algorithms

- **Grid Search CV:** Optimizes hyperparameters for each model using a grid of values.
- **Cross-Validation:** Evaluates models using multiple splits of the data to ensure robustness.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualizes the performance of a classification model.
- **ROC Curve:** Plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate.

## Performance Metrics

### Evaluation Results

The performance of each model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** Measures the percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision:** Measures the proportion of predicted positives that are actually positive.
- **Recall:** Measures the proportion of actual positives that are predicted positive.
- **F1 Score:** A weighted average of precision and recall.
- **ROC AUC Score:** Measures the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

### Benchmark Comparisons

The models are compared to benchmark scores based on previously published results.

### Model Strengths
